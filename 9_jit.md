# how to run it
you have to install pypy3 version as it's already equipped with JIT compiler
1. python3 filename.py (NO JUT)
2. pypy3 filename.py  (WIT JIT)

### Explanation:
- The entries for **CPython** and **PyPy** are grouped under each test case for clarity.
- The **Faster** column indicates which interpreter performed better for each test case.
